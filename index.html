                <p>Hey. My name is Tyler. I’ve worn a lot of hats when it comes to “work”; from video production to copywriting, graphic design, and brand management. I’ve always liked to make stuff, and I enjoy the process of building things from terrible diy furniture projects to lego sets with my son. Maybe that’s why I’m an aspiring Front End Engineer… I’ve been coding for the last 3 months and I love it. My goal is to land a remote front end gig to build a better future for my family, my self, and maybe even the world (a kid at heart can dream right?). Thanks for stopping by and clicking around. Here’s to better late than never!
